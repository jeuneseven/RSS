The event, dubbed The Determination Symphony , will be held on June 22, and tickets are on sale now. The Determination Symphony is described as “a musical journey from your initial fall at Mount Ebott, leading you through Froggit Village, the Snowdin Forest, Temmie Village and so much more.” Attendees (who I’m deeply envious of) will be able to watch all of that on screen while the orchestra makes its way through arrangements of the soundtrack.",
