Amazon's Zoox recalled software for all 270 vehicles following an April 8th incident where an unoccupied robotaxi in Las Vegas collided with a passenger car. The crash occurred when the robotaxi, traveling over 40mph, misinterpreted the intentions of a vehicle approaching from a perpendicular driveway. Zoox's update, deployed April 16-17, addresses situations where the AI incorrectly predicts that a yielding vehicle will proceed into its lane. The collision caused minor damage with no injuries. This follows a March recall addressing sudden braking issues that caused motorcycle rear-end collisions.
