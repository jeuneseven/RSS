To celebrate Undertale's 10th anniversary, a special orchestral concert called "The Determination Symphony" will be held at London's Eventim Apollo on June 22. A 25-piece orchestra will perform arrangements of Toby Fox's beloved soundtrack while visuals from the game play on screen. The musical journey will cover iconic locations from Mount Ebott through Froggit Village, Snowdin Forest, and Temmie Village. Tickets are currently on sale for this one-night-only event.
