Zoox, owned by Amazon, recalled all 270 of its robotaxis after a minor crash in Las Vegas on April 8 involving an unoccupied vehicle. The incident occurred when the robotaxi misjudged a car approaching from a perpendicular driveway at over 40mph, leading to a collision despite braking. A software update issued on April 16â€“17 addressed this issue. Zoox reported no injuries and described the crash in a voluntary recall notice to the NHTSA. A prior recall in March followed similar incidents involving sudden braking by its Toyota Highlander-based robotaxis.
