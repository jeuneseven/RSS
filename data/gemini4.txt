A US federal jury ordered NSO Group to pay Meta $167.25 million for hacking 1,400 WhatsApp users with Pegasus spyware. This ruling follows Meta's 2019 lawsuit after Citizen Lab found the spyware could be installed via phone calls, compromising user data. Meta views this as a crucial step against illegal spyware and plans to seek a court order to prevent future targeting of WhatsApp. NSO Group intends to appeal the verdict.
