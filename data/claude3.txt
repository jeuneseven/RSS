Nintendo announced Tamagotchi Plaza, a new Corner Shop-style game launching June 27 for Nintendo Switch. The game allows players to act as shopkeepers preparing for a Tamagotchi festival, with local two-player options available. A key feature is compatibility with the Tamagotchi Uni device, enabling players to unlock exclusive items, special events, and unique conversations by linking their physical Tamagotchi to the game, similar to the old TamaTown website functionality.
