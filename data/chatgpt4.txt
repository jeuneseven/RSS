A U.S. jury has ordered Israeli spyware firm NSO Group to pay Meta \$167.25 million for hacking 1,400 WhatsApp users with its Pegasus spyware. Meta initially sued in 2019 after researchers found Pegasus could infect phones via missed calls and access cameras, messages, and location data. Victims included journalists, activists, and diplomats. The court also awarded Meta \$444,719 in damages. Meta praised the verdict as a major step for user privacy and plans to seek a court order to block NSO from targeting WhatsApp. NSO plans to appeal.
