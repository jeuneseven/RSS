A California federal jury ordered Israeli spyware firm NSO Group to pay Meta $167.25 million for hacking 1,400 WhatsApp users. The hack, discovered in 2019, exploited a vulnerability allowing Pegasus spyware installation through unanswered phone calls, targeting journalists, activists, and diplomats. Meta plans to seek an injunction preventing further WhatsApp targeting and will donate to digital rights organizations. NSO Group intends to appeal the verdict. This represents the first successful case against the spyware industry, which Meta called "an important step forward for privacy and security."
