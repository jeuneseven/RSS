Amazon's Zoox issued a software recall for all 270 of its robotaxis after an April 8th Las Vegas crash. The update, rolled out mid-April, addresses a flaw where vehicles over 40mph might inaccurately predict other cars' movements from perpendicular driveways, leading to collisions. No injuries occurred in the crash, only minor damage. This follows a previous recall in March for sudden braking issues in its Toyota Highlander-based robotaxis.
