Senate Democrats introduced a bill to ban federal officials and their families from issuing digital assets, targeting Donald Trump's crypto holdings. This "End Crypto Corruption Act" follows concerns that a previous bipartisan bill was insufficient after reports of potential $2 billion earnings for the Trump family from a stablecoin deal and a meme coin contest offering White House access. While Republicans also expressed skepticism, they acknowledge the legality of current activities, advocating for a clearer regulatory framework.
