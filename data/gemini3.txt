Bandai Namco is resurrecting the "Tamagotchi Connection: Corner Shop" series with "Tamagotchi Plaza," launching June 27th on Nintendo Switch. Players become shopkeepers preparing for a festival. Crucially, the game will link with the Tamagotchi Uni device, offering exclusive items, events, and conversations, rekindling the old TamaTown experience. This provides a fresh incentive for Uni owners.
