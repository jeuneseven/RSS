      "extractive_summary": "“Currently, people who wish to cultivate influence with the president can enrich him personally by buying cryptocurrency he owns or controls,” said Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-OR), who introduced the bill to the Senate floor, in a press release . Let’s end this corruption immediately.” The End Crypto Corruption Act comes in response to concerns inside the Democratic party that the GENIUS Act, which previously had strong bipartisan support, was inadequate at preventing corruption. First, a New York Times report last week revealed that the Trump family could potentially earn $2 billion from a stablecoin transaction with a Dubai-based investment firm under the current regulatory framework. Second, Trump announced a contest in April wherein the top holders of his meme coin would win a private dinner with the president, and the top 25 holders would win an additional guided tour of the White House. According to a report from Chainalysis, the meme coin’s issuers, Official Trump, have earned $320 million from trading fees from the contest alone.",
      "abstractive_summary": "As the Trump family’s cryptocurrency empire continues to grow, Democrats in the US Senate are taking a stand against the president and his family’s ownership of digital assets.... and they’re not going to let it go to waste..",
      "hybrid_summary": "A new bill has been introduced in the US Senate that would ban the use of cryptocurrencies by members of the Trump family and other government officials.., and would also ban the use of cryptocurrencies by members of the Trump family and other government officials.",

      "extractive_summary": "The update rolled out between April 16th and 17th to address a risky situation that could arise when the vehicle operating at over 40mph closed in on another vehicle that approaches its lane from a perpendicular driveway before stopping. Zoox shared how the incident played out in the voluntary safety recall report it sent to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) on May 1st: The incident involved a passenger car quickly approaching the lane where our purpose-built robotaxi was traveling. Instead, the car came to a stop, fully yielding to the Zoox robotaxi and remaining in the shoulder lane. The Zoox robotaxi braked hard, but contact was unavoidable. A March recall notice from Zoox also notes that after two incidents where its Toyota Highlander-based robotaxis performed sudden hard braking, causing approaching motorcyclists to rear-end them , it rolled out a software update to address the problem last November.",
      "abstractive_summary": "A self-driving car company has issued a safety update for all of its vehicles after one of its vehicles crashed into a vehicle that was approaching its lane from a perpendicular driveway. The report states that, prior to the update, the company says, “In situations where Zoox vehicles are operating at speeds greater than 40mph, and a vehicle incrementally encroaches from a perpendicular driveway approaching the Zoox vehicle’s lane, the Zoox vehicle may make an inaccurately confident prediction that the vehicle is going to proceed into the Zoox vehicle’s lane.” Reacting based on that inaccurate projection could cause a crash, as happened here.",

Pegasus could then turn on a user’s camera and microphone, look through emails and text messages, and access location information.
