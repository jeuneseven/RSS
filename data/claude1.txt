Democratic senators introduced the "End Crypto Corruption Act" after withdrawing support from a bipartisan stablecoin bill. The new legislation aims to prevent federal officials and their families from issuing digital assets, directly targeting Trump's cryptocurrency activities. Senator Merkley called Trump's crypto ventures "a profoundly corrupt scheme" that endangers national security. Democrats' concerns intensified after reports that the Trump family could earn $2 billion from a Dubai stablecoin deal and after Trump launched a contest offering White House access to top holders of his meme coin, which has reportedly generated $320 million in trading fees.
