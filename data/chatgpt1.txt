Senate Democrats have withdrawn support from a bipartisan stablecoin bill and introduced the End Crypto Corruption Act, targeting Donald Trump and his family's involvement in digital assets. The move follows reports that Trump could profit $2 billion from a stablecoin deal and has tied meme coin ownership to exclusive events, raising corruption and national security concerns. The bill aims to ban federal officials and their families from issuing cryptocurrencies. Some Republicans, including Sen. Cynthia Lummis, expressed support for clearer regulations to address the growing influence of political figures in unregulated digital asset schemes.
