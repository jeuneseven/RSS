A Nexus Point News article claiming director Alex Garland would helm an "Elden Ring" film for A24 was published and quickly removed. The story spread when popular gaming news account Wario64 (1M+ followers) shared it on X. The Verge found the source suspicious, noting Nexus Point News lacks credibility as an entertainment news breaker. This incident demonstrates how unverified information can rapidly circulate online through established channels, even when the original source lacks reliability. The article's retraction without explanation further highlights issues with online news verification.
